## Welcome to The NLP Lab Pages

The Natural Language Processing Lab (NLP-Lab) has a simple motto:

*You cannot train yourself a car. You cannot machine-learn a tire for it. You have to engineer it.*

We do train models, but we actually build and engineer systems. If we know something about language in general or a language in particular, we enjoy using this knowledge in engineering of NLP and AI technologies.


The NLP Lab is located at Indiana University. We use Slack for communication and we meet 3 times a week on campus at IU Bloomington. The current meeting location is Ballantine Hall 844.

## Focus

During the Fall 2019 semester we will focus on:

- Knowledge Graph extraction and visualization from unstructured text and images/videos.
- Entailment and Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (and Description Logic).
- Processing of the Mueller Report: corpus analysis, prediction models, Knowledge Graph and Event Graph extraction, time reference and sequencing along time axis ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/SemiringInc/Mueller-Report-Corpus)). The cleaned out text corpus with basic annotations is finally available. More data coming soon.
